# User-Activity-Monitor
## Overview

The User Activity Monitor is a Python application designed to track user activity on a desktop computer. It monitors keyboard and mouse inputs to calculate user idle time, ultimately providing insights into the user's actual working time. The application also includes features for saving this data securely as an encrypted file and provides the option to decrypt and view the stored information.

## Features

- **User Activity Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of keyboard and mouse inputs to determine user activity and idle time.

- **Idle Time Calculation:** Accurate calculation of user idle time based on input patterns.

- **Working Time Assessment:** Computation of the user's actual working time on the desktop.

- **Data Encryption:** Secure encryption of user data, including activity logs and working time records.

- **File Storage:** Saving encrypted data as a file on the local computer for easy access.

- **Decryption and Viewing:** Option to decrypt and view saved activity data for analysis.

## Use Cases

- **Productivity Enhancement:** Gain insights into desktop activity for productivity improvement.

- **Time Management:** Track working hours accurately for effective time management.

- **Data Privacy:** Ensure data privacy and security through encryption.

- **Performance Evaluation:** Monitor employee working hours and productivity securely.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Tkinter
- **Data Encryption:** Cryptography libraries (e.g., cryptography module in Python)
- **File I/O:** Python file handling modules
- **User Input Monitoring:** Libraries or modules for keyboard and mouse event handling (e.g., pyinput or pynput)
